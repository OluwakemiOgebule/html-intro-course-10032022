  <h1>Panasonic, Equinor and Hydro to explore potential for European battery business</h1>

<main>
  <p>The companies will work together towards summer 2021 to assess the market for lithium-ion batteries in Europe and mature the business case for a green battery business located in Norway. The companies intend that this initiative is based on Panasonic’s leading technology and targets the European market for electric vehicles and other applications.</p>
  <p>The companies will also investigate the potential for an integrated battery value chain and for co-location of supply chain partners. The findings from this initial exploratory phase will form the basis for subsequent decisions.</p>
  <p>This collaboration combines Panasonic’s position as an innovative technology company and leader in lithium-ion batteries, with the deep industrial experience of Equinor and Hydro, both strong global players, to potentially pave way for a robust and sustainable battery business in Norway. Panasonic has powered the last two revolutions in the automotive industry – first by powering hybrids and now, by powering multiple generations of all electric vehicles. We are pleased to enter into this initiative to explore implementing sustainable, highly advanced technology and supply chains to deliver on the exacting needs of lithium-ion battery customers and support the renewable energy sector in the European region.</p>

  <h2>Why invest?</h2>

  One barrel of oil produced at Johan Sverdrup during the first year has emitted 0.17kg CO₂ – almost 100 times lower than the global average (measured in kilogrammes of CO₂ per barrel produced). This is mainly due to the power supply from shore.
  The Johan Sverdrup field came on stream on 5 October 2019 – more than two months ahead of schedule and with investment costs that were NOK 40 billion lower than the original estimate in the plan for development and operation (PDO).
  Johan Sverdrup phase 2 includes the construction of a subsea production system, reconstruction of the existing riser platform and a new p rocessing platform (P2).
  Phase 2 will also accommodate a converter plant for shore-based power supply. The plant will distribute power to other fields on the Utsira
  - High: Edvard Grieg, Ivar Aasen, Gina Krog and Sleipner. The four existing platforms on the Johan Sverdrup field are already receiving power from shore.
  - Production start is expected in the fourth quarter of 2022.
